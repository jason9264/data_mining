## **Overview**

This repository contains three distinct data analysis projects conducted by the Orange 4 team. Each project focuses on a unique subject and methodology, demonstrating expertise in association analysis, decision tree modeling, and clustering techniques. Below is a summary of the three included projects:

1. **Eats4Life Association Analysis**: Optimizing menu wine pairings for a restaurant.
2. **CMC Banking Insurance Product**: Predicting customer likelihood of purchasing annuities using decision tree models.
3. **Teenage Segmentation Analysis**: Clustering teenagers based on social media activity for targeted marketing.


## **Project Descriptions**

### **1. Eats4Life Association Analysis**
- **Objective**: Enhance Eats4Life's menu by identifying optimal wine pairings for main entrées using association analysis.
- **Key Findings**:
  - Filet Mignon pairs best with Blackstone Merlot (36% confidence).
  - Sea Bass pairs with Duckhorn Chardonnay (25% confidence).
  - Inventory prioritization for high-demand wines like Blackstone Merlot.
- **Methodology**: Association rule mining using metrics like support, confidence, and lift.
- **Deliverables**: Wine pairing recommendations, inventory insights, and visualizations.

### **2. CMC Banking Insurance Product**
- **Objective**: Predict which customers are most likely to purchase a variable rate annuity product using decision tree models.
- **Key Findings**:
  - The conditional inference tree (ctree) outperformed recursive partitioning trees (rpart) in lift metrics.
  - Key predictors include savings account balance (SAVBAL) and certificate of deposit ownership (CD).
- **Methodology**: Comparison of decision trees (ctree vs. rpart) with logistic regression benchmarks.
- **Deliverables**: Model performance metrics, gains tables, and marketing recommendations.

### **3. Teenage Segmentation Analysis**
- **Objective**: Segment teenagers into clusters based on social media activity to identify consumer archetypes.
- **Key Findings**:
  - Identified distinct clusters based on usage of specific terms in status updates.
  - Profiles created to help marketers understand each group’s interests and behavior.
- **Methodology**: Data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, PCA visualization, and clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means, hierarchical clustering).
- **Deliverables**: Cluster profiles, visualizations, and segmentation recommendations.
